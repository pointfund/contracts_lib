8,0,title,Request for Consent to the Granting of Security Interest in the Economic Interest in an R3001 Contract CHECKLIST
8,1,point address,"A Security Agreement is an agreement that an Agency and Lender (Seller and/or third party providing financing) may choose to enter into that allows the Lender to obtain a security interest in the Agency’s economic interest in a book of business. The R3001 contract prohibits an agency from granting a security interest in the economic interest in a book of business without Allstate’s express consent. Completion of this form constitutes Allstate’s consent to the granting of a security interest in the economic interest in the book of business. Please note that it is the lender’s responsibility to properly file appropriate financing statements or other documents in order to secure their interest.
<b>It is important that both the Agent and the Lender review the following checklist before completing the attached Request for Consent to the Granting of Security Interest documents. Failure to properly complete the Request for Consent documents
will delay consent by Allstate to the granting of a security interest to the Lender. Please note that:
“Agent” – means the individual (whether Agency Owner or Key Person) who has signed the R3001 contract with Allstate “Agency” – means the entity (whether sole proprietorship or corporation/LLC)) who has an R3001 contract with Allstate “Agency Name” – means the entity named on the R3001 contract, not the DBA. Agency and Agency Name are the same.</b>"

8,5,para 01,"Each Agency location has its own R3001 contract and distinct Agent Number -- In order to obtain consent for a security interest in the economic interest in an R3001 contract on more than one location of an Agency, a separate Granting of Security Interest/Security Agreement must be submitted for each Agency location.
Business Entity -- The business entity shown on the Request for Consent documents must be the same business entity shown on the R3001 contract in order for Allstate to consent to the granting of a security interest.
Multiple Security Interests -- If the Agency has an existing Granting of Security Interest/Security Agreement and/or Assignment of TPP on file with Allstate, the Lender(s) in subordinate position(s) must provide written acknowledgement of their position in order for Allstate to consent to the granting of an additional security interest. A Lender may choose to acknowledge subordinate position in the top right corner of the Notice to Lender (green box).
Notice of Termination of Security Interest – Proper notice must be presented to Allstate before a security interest in the economic interest in an active R3001 contract can be terminated. Such notice will at a minimum contain a release letter signed by the Lender or a court order terminating the security interest. Such notice is not effective until received by Allstate.
Sale of Economic Interest -- Per the Exclusive Agency Independent Contractor Manual, an Agent selling the economic interest in an Agency’s book of business shall notify Allstate and the Lender of their intent to sell. The Seller shall also notify the Buyer of the existence of any existing security interests.
Election of Termination Payments -- Upon notification of the termination of the R3001 Agreement and the election of the termination payment option by the Agent, Allstate will contact the Lender to obtain the payoff amount. Allstate will make termination payments to the Lender until one of the following occurs: the specified payoff amount is reached; the Total Termination Payment Value for the location has been reached; or the Lender has provided a release letter. Any remaining termination payments will be paid by Allstate directly to the Agency."

 Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the R3001 Agreement, the Agency acquires an economic interest in
the Allstate business written by the Agency which can be sold only to a Company-approved buyer or the Agent can

 The R3001 Agreement may be terminated at any time by mutual agreement of the parties in writing; by either party

8,111,item 59,"The Granting of Security Interest and assignment contracts require an Agency to provide prompt notice to Lender(s) if its relationship with Allstate is terminating. However, as a service to lenders, Allstate publishes a list of Agencies who have active Grantings of Security Interest or Assignments with the Allstate Lending Connection® and who have provided or received a 90 day* notice of termination (or such greater number of days as is required by law). This list
is called the Estimated Termination Report.
Lenders may find the Estimated Termination Report, which lists Agencies who may be terminating their relationship with Allstate at this url: http://www.allstate.com/careers/termagents.aspx"
