Allstate’s approval of this request is conditioned on receipt of your acknowledgement that you have received and reviewed the following information regarding this assignment: 
"
9,25,form agent C,"- Agent and Lender acknowledge that they have read and understood the Commission Payment Agreement.
- All five completed and signed Assignment of Commission documents must be received by the Allstate Lending Connection® no later than the fifteenth of the month prior to the requested Commencement Month. If the document share received later than the twentieth of the month, they will be held and processed in the following month.
- Unless otherwise indicated above by the Agent and Lender, all Assignment of Commission documents received by the twentieth of the month will be reviewed with the following month’s assignments. Incomplete or incorrect documents will cause a delay in the first payment made to the Lender.
- The processing fee must also be submitted by the twentieth of the month prior to the Commencement Month. If the payment is not received or authorized on Ex C, the documents will be placed on hold until the processing fee or Ex C is submitted, which will delay the first payment to the Lender. If the check for the Assignment of Commission fee is returned for any reason, the Allstate Lending Connection® reserves the right to terminate the Assignment of Commission.
- If the Agent and Lender wish to refinance (change the Monthly Deduction or Total Deduction Amount), the existing assignment must be terminated and a new Assignment of Commission must be executed. The refinance processing fee must accompany the new Assignment of Commission. <b> If the fee is not received, there will be no change in the Monthly Deduction Amount or Total Deduction Amount.</b>
- The Commission Amount is the amount remaining after all amounts that the Company is authorized or required by law to deduct. If the Commission Amount is then insufficient to pay the full Monthly Deduction Amount to the Lender, the Company shall pay that Commission Amount to the Lender and the difference between the Commission Amount paid to the Lender and the Monthly Deduction Amount is a “Shortfall”.
- For any month in which a Shortfall occurs, the Agency Commission Amounts from all Agency locations will be used to offset that month’s Shortfall. Any Shortfalls will be reflected in the loan balance.
- Payment to the Lender will be made within twenty business days of when the Agency is due to be paid monthly commissions. Allstate pays commissions on the {pay-nth}  <b>business </b> day of each month. For any payment-related questions, please contact IBM. 
- Agency shall provide notice to Lender promptly upon termination of the R3001 Agreement with the Company. Agency shall also notify any potential buyer of the economic interest of any outstanding loans incurred in connection with the book of business. 
- A minimum of 45 days notice must be given to the Allstate Lending Connection® prior to the early termination of the Commission Payment Agreement. The request to terminate must be accompanied by a letter signed by both parties acknowledging the early termination.
- If the Lender assigns its rights under the agreement, no change to the payment destination will be made without a new Payment Election Form which must be submitted 45 days prior to the effective date.
- The Commission Payment Agreement will terminate upon termination of the Agency’s R3001 Agreement.
- The maximum term of a Commission Payment Agreement is 180 months (15 years)."
