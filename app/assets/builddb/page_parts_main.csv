Maker further agrees that, should any default occur or exist under this Note, any waiver or
forbearance on the part of Holder to pursue the rights and remedies available to Holder shall be
binding upon Holder only to the extent that Holder specifically agrees to any such waiver or
forbearance in writing. A waiver or forbearance on the part of Holder as to one default shall not
be construed as a waiver or forbearance as to any other default."

- Unless otherwise indicated above by the Agent and Lender, all Assignment of Commission documents received by the twentieth of the month will be reviewed with the following month’s assignments. Incomplete or incorrect documents will cause a delay in the first payment made to the Lender.
- The processing fee must also be submitted by the twentieth of the month prior to the Commencement Month. If the payment is not received or authorized on Ex C, the documents will be placed on hold until the processing fee or Ex C is submitted, which will delay the first payment to the Lender. If the check for the Assignment of Commission fee is returned for any reason, the Allstate Lending Connection® reserves the right to terminate the Assignment of Commission.
- If the Agent and Lender wish to refinance (change the Monthly Deduction or Total Deduction Amount), the existing assignment must be terminated and a new Assignment of Commission must be executed. The refinance processing fee must accompany the new Assignment of Commission. <b> If the fee is not received, there will be no change in the Monthly Deduction Amount or Total Deduction Amount.</b>
- The Commission Amount is the amount remaining after all amounts that the Company is authorized or required by law to deduct. If the Commission Amount is then insufficient to pay the full Monthly Deduction Amount to the Lender, the Company shall pay that Commission Amount to the Lender and the difference between the Commission Amount paid to the Lender and the Monthly Deduction Amount is a “Shortfall”.
- For any month in which a Shortfall occurs, the Agency Commission Amounts from all Agency locations will be used to offset that month’s Shortfall. Any Shortfalls will be reflected in the loan balance.
- Payment to the Lender will be made within twenty business days of when the Agency is due to be paid monthly commissions. Allstate pays commissions on the {pay-nth}  <b>business </b> day of each month. For any payment-related questions, please contact IBM. 
- Agency shall provide notice to Lender promptly upon termination of the R3001 Agreement with the Company. Agency shall also notify any potential buyer of the economic interest of any outstanding loans incurred in connection with the book of business. 
- A minimum of 45 days notice must be given to the Allstate Lending Connection® prior to the early termination of the Commission Payment Agreement. The request to terminate must be accompanied by a letter signed by both parties acknowledging the early termination.
- If the Lender assigns its rights under the agreement, no change to the payment destination will be made without a new Payment Election Form which must be submitted 45 days prior to the effective date.
- The Commission Payment Agreement will terminate upon termination of the Agency’s R3001 Agreement.
- The maximum term of a Commission Payment Agreement is 180 months (15 years)."

CHECKLIST"
8,1,point address,"A Security Agreement is an agreement that an Agency and Lender (Seller and/or third party providing financing) may choose to enter into that allows the Lender to obtain a security interest in the Agency’s economic interest in a book of business. The R3001 contract prohibits an agency from granting a security interest in the economic interest in a book of business without Allstate’s express consent. Completion of this form constitutes Allstate’s consent to the granting of a security interest in the economic interest in the book of business. Please note that it is the lender’s responsibility to properly file appropriate financing statements or other documents in order to secure their interest.

It is important that both the Agent and the Lender review the following checklist before completing the attached Request for Consent to the Granting of Security Interest documents. Failure to properly complete the Request for Consent documents will delay consent by Allstate to the granting of a security interest to the Lender. Please note that:
<b>“Agent” –.</b> means the individual (whether Agency Owner or Key Person) who has signed the R3001 contract with Allstate 
<b>“Agency” – </b> means the entity (whether sole proprietorship or corporation/LLC)) who has an R3001 contract with Allstate

<b>Business Entity </b> -- The business entity shown on the Request for Consent documents must be the same business entity shown on the R3001 contract in order for Allstate to consent to the granting of a security interest.

<b>Multiple Security Interests </b> -- If the Agency has an existing Granting of Security Interest/Security Agreement and/or Assignment of TPP on file with Allstate, the Lender(s) in subordinate position(s) must provide written acknowledgement of their position in order for Allstate to consent to the granting of an additional security interest. A Lender may choose to acknowledge subordinate position in the top right corner of the Notice to Lender (green box).

<b>Notice of Termination of Security Interest </b> – Proper notice must be presented to Allstate before a security interest in the economic interest in an active R3001 contract can be terminated. Such notice will at a minimum contain a release letter signed by the Lender or a court order terminating the security interest. Such notice is not effective until received by Allstate.

<b>Sale of Economic Interest </b>-- Per the Exclusive Agency Independent Contractor Manual, an Agent selling the economic interest in an Agency’s book of business shall notify Allstate and the Lender of their intent to sell. The Seller shall also notify the Buyer of the existence of any existing security interests.

<b>Election of Termination Payments </b>-- Upon notification of the termination of the R3001 Agreement and the election of the termination payment option by the Agent, Allstate will contact the Lender to obtain the payoff amount.

++  Allstate retains ownership of the Agency’s book of business upon termination of the R3001 Agreement (excluding any Assigned Risk, JUA, Flood and FAIR Plan business).

++  Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the R3001 Agreement, the Agency acquires an economic interest in the Allstate business written by the Agency which can be sold only to a Company-approved buyer or the Agent can elect to receive a termination payment from Allstate.

++  The R3001 Agreement may be terminated at any time by mutual agreement of the parties in writing; by either party with or without cause upon providing 90 days prior written notice to the other (or such greater number of days as is required by law); or by the Company with cause, immediately upon written notice being provided to the Agency.Agent is obligated to promptly provide notice to Lender of Agency termination.

++  The Agent has up to 3 full calendar months (or such greater number of days as is required by law) from the date of the written notice of termination to either sell the economic interest in the book of business to a Company approved buyer or
to elect the termination payment.

++  Agent shall also notify any potential buyer of the economic interest of any outstanding loans secured by or incurred in connection with the book of business.

++  If the Agent sells the economic interest in an Agency’s book of business to a Company-approved buyer, the Company is not obligated to notify the Lender or make a termination payment.

++  The terms of the sale of the economic interest in the book of business, including the sale price, are determined by the Agent and the approved buyer. Other than approval of the buyer, Allstate is not a party to the transaction and the proceeds from the sale are received by the Agent/Agency directly from the buyer.

However, as a service to lenders, Allstate publishes a list of Agencies who have active Grantings of Security Interest or Assignments with the Allstate Lending Connection® and who have provided or received a 90 day* notice of termination (or such greater number of days as is required by law). This list
is called the Estimated Termination Report.

Lenders may find the Estimated Termination Report, which lists Agencies who may be terminating their relationship with Allstate at this url: http://www.allstate.com/careers/termagents.aspx"
8,112,item 60,"Once an Agency terminates an affiliation with Allstate, their entry will be removed from the list. The information that is
provided includes:"
