3,33,Para 13,"<u>Maker’s Waivers </u>. Maker hereby waives presentment for payment, protest, notice of protest and
notice of nonpayment, and all pleas of division and discussion. Maker agrees that Holder’s
acceptance of payment other than in accordance with the terms of this Note or Holder’s
subsequent agreement to extend or modify such repayment terms, or Holder’s failure or delay in
exercising any rights or remedies granted to Holder, shall not have the effect of releasing Maker
from Maker’s obligations to Holder. In addition, any failure or delay on the part of Holder to
exercise any of the rights and remedies granted to Holder shall not have the effect of waiving any
of Holder’s rights and remedies. Any partial exercise of any rights and/or remedies granted to

Maker further agrees that, should any default occur or exist under this Note, any waiver or
forbearance on the part of Holder to pursue the rights and remedies available to Holder shall be
binding upon Holder only to the extent that Holder specifically agrees to any such waiver or
forbearance in writing. A waiver or forbearance on the part of Holder as to one default shall not
be construed as a waiver or forbearance as to any other default."
3,34,Para 14,"<u>Representations and Warranties .</u> Maker represents and warrants to Holder that the Principal Amount loaned to Maker by Holder shall be used exclusively for commercial purposes in furtherance of Maker’s business as an insurance agent. Maker represents and warrants to Holder that the insurance contracts set forth on Exhibit B hereto (the “ Contracts ”) are valid and effective as of the date hereof and that for as long as each Contract remains effective, Maker is entitled to receive a monthly commission relating to such Contract as set forth on Exhibit B hereto (the “ <u>Commissions </u>”). Maker represents and warrants to Holder that all Commissions are payable by wire transfer to the account of Maker set forth on Exhibit A hereto. Maker further agrees to immediately notify Holder to the extent any Contract is terminated for any reason whatsoever."
3,35,Para 15,"<u>Indemnity .</u> Maker agrees to indemnify Holder against and to hold Holder harmless from any and all losses, liabilities, expenses, claims, or damages of whatever kind or nature, including Holder’s reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs (to be reimbursed as and when incurred) resulting from Holder’s loan to Maker or the exercise of its remedies under this Note, even if such losses, liabilities, expenses, claims, or damages resulted, in whole or in part, from the Holder’s negligence."
